# Bike-Share Analytics
**Academic Project - Supervised Machine Learning**

## Indroduction

This project was done collaboratively via the Google Collab Notebook. The objective of this project was to use machine learning to analyze a classic Kaggle Bikeshare dataset without using established ML python libraries.

## Configuration and Installation
Our dataset is from the [Kaggle Bikeshare Dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data?select=test.csv)). For our analysis, we pulled relevant attributes and combined certain columns do gain a deeper understanding of trend data. Either dataset can be used for analysis, but for our particular code, the hour.csv file was used. From there, the files ml.py and final_project_graphs.py were used to create ML and analytical models respectively.

## Challenges
We did not face many challenges with the coding aspect of this. All of the uploaded code was used to cross check our deconstructed ML models.

## Credits
This was a final project for a Supervised Machine Learning course and was done collaboratively with my project partner Owen Davey.
